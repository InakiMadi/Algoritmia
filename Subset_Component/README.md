# Hard - Problem solving (Advanced)

## Installation

First install this package with:

``pip install -e .``

## Problem

You are given an array with 64-bit integers: d[0], d[1], ..., d[n-1].

BIT(x, i) = (x >> i) & 1, where is the i^{th} lower bit of x in binary form. If we regard every bit as a vertex of a
graph G, there is an undirected edge between vertices i and j if there is a value k such that BIT(d[k], i) == 1 && BIT(
d[k], j) == 1.

For every subset of the input array, how many connected-components are there in that graph?

A connected component in a graph is a set of nodes which are accessible to each other via a path of edges. There may be
multiple connected components in a graph.

## Example

In the real challenge, there will be 64 nodes associated with each integer in d represented as a 64 bit binary value.
For clarity, only 4 bits will be shown in the example but all 64 will be considered in the calculations.

    Decimal  Binary Edges   Node ends
    d[0] = 1   0001   0
    d[1] = 2   0010   0
    d[2] = 3   0011   1       0 and 1
    d[3] = 5   0101   1       0 and 2

Consider all subsets:

                 Edges
    Subset   Count  Nodes  Connected components
    {1}         0           64
    {2}         0           64
    {3}         1   0-1     63
    {5}         1   0-2     63
    {1,2}       0           64
    {1,3}       1   0-1     63
    {1,5}       1   0-2     63
    {2,3}       1   0-1     63
    {2,5}       1   0-2     63
    {3,5}       2   0-1-2   62
    {1,2,3}     1   0-1     63
    {1,2,5}     1   0-2     63
    {1,3,5}     2   0-1-2   62
    {2,3,5}     2   0-1-2   62
    {1,2,3,5}   2   0-1-2   62
    Sum                    944

The values 3 and 5 have 2 bits set, so they have 1 edge each. If a subset contains only a 3 or 5, there will be one
connected component with 2 nodes, and 62 components with 1 node for a total of 63.

If both 3 and 5 are in a subset, 1 component with nodes 0,1 and 2 is formed since node 0 is one end of each edge
described. The other 61 nodes are solitary, so there are 62 connected components total.

All other values have only 1 bit set, so they have no edges. They have 64 components with 1 node each.

## Function Description

Complete the findConnectedComponents function in the editor below.

findConnectedComponents has the following parameters:

int d[n]: an array of integers

#### Returns

int: the sum of the number of connected components for all subsets of d

#### Input Format

The first row contains the integer n, the size of d[].
The next row has n space-separated integers, d[i].

#### Constraints

1 <= n <= 20

0 <= d[i] <= 2^{63} - 1

### Sample Input

3
2 5 9

### Sample Output

504

### Explanation

There are 8 subset of {2,5,9}.

{}
=> We don't have any number in this subset => no edge in the graph => Every node is a component by itself => Number of
connected-components = 64.

{2}
=> The Binary Representation of 2 is 00000010. There is a bit at only one position. => So there is no edge in the graph,
every node is a connected-component by itself => Number of connected-components = 64.

{5}
=> The Binary Representation of 5 is 00000101. There is a bit at the 0th and 2nd position. => So there is an edge: (0,2)
in the graph => There is one component with a pair of nodes (0,2) in the graph. Apart from that, all remaining 62
vertices are indepenent components of one node each (1,3,4,5,6...63) => Number of connected-components = 63.

{9}
=> The Binary Representation of 9 is 00001001. => There is a 1-bit at the 0th and 3rd position in this binary
representation. => edge: (0, 3) in the graph => Number of components = 63

{2, 5}
=> This will contain the edge (0, 2) in the graph which will form one component
=> Other nodes are all independent components
=> Number of connected-component = 63

{2, 9}
=> This has edge (0,3) in the graph
=> Similar to examples above, this has 63 connected components

{5, 9}
=> This has edges (0, 2) and (0, 3) in the graph
=> Similar to examples above, this has 62 connected components

{2, 5, 9}
=> This has edges(0, 2) (0, 3) in the graph. All three vertices (0,2,3) make one component => Other 61 vertices are all
independent components
=> Number of connected-components = 62

S = 64 + 64 + 63 + 63 + 63 + 63 + 62 + 62 = 504
